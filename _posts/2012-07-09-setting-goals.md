'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'  
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.  
'I don't much care where â€”' said Alice.  
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat

Large companies have a annual or a bi-annual exercise where they setup their yearly and the next six month's goals. I don't think many startups are doing it, or at least we weren't doing this until recently. We recently started doing a goal setting exercise every 6 months, and we have found it very useful to keep the big picture in mind.

Most people already know what they want to do with their career and their life in the medium time-window of one year. A formal goal setting is useful even if you already know *exactly* what your goals are. Thinking through puts clarity to the goals. Recording the goals takes away the liberty of punting later at a goal which you did not achieve and saying "this wasn't actually my goal".

Things you need to put in your goals list.

1. What do you want to do/build in the next one year?
2. What do you want to learn in the next one year.
3. What help do you need from your company to achieve your goals.

Your goals need to be [SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). 
Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time bound.

Here are some bad goals.

1. I want to get better at Python. (Not specific, how do you want to do it.)
2. I want to keep the customers happy. (Not measurable, how do you know they are happy?)
3. I want to read 200 fictions books the next year. (Probably not achievable, unless thats the only job you do.)

Here are some good goals.

1. I want to read the code of at least 8 open source libraries to learn how people are using Python.
2. I want at least 80 of my clients to rate "very happy" in the end of project review.
3. I want to read 10 fiction and 10 non fiction books in the next year.


### How I manage my goals list

I like keeping it simple. I have a dropbox folder which keeps my yearly todo list as a text file. Every month I will review the yearly todo list and create a monthly todo list. At the end of the month I will look at the monthly todo list and measure how many I was able to achieve before creating the next month's todo list.
