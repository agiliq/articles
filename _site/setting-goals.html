title: Setting Goals
excerpt: Why do you need to set goals</p>

<h2>category: General</h2>

<p>'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'<br/>
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.<br/>
'I don't much care where â€”' said Alice.<br/>
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland</a></p>

<p>Large companies have a annual or a bi-annual exercise where they setup their yearly and the next six month's goals. I don't think many startups are doing it, or at least we weren't doing this until recently. We recently started doing a goal setting exercise every 6 months, and we have found it very useful to keep the big picture in mind.</p>

<p>Most people already know what they want to do with their career and their life in the medium time-window of one year. A formal goal setting is useful even if you already know <em>exactly</em> what your goals are. Thinking through puts clarity to the goals. Recording the goals takes away the liberty of punting later at a goal which you did not achieve and saying "this wasn't actually my goal".</p>

<p>Things you need to put in your goals list.</p>

<ol>
<li>What do you want to do/build in the next one year?</li>
<li>What do you want to learn in the next one year.</li>
<li>What help do you need from your company to achieve your goals.</li>
</ol>


<p>Your goals need to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a>.
Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time bound.</p>

<p>Here are some bad goals.</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to get better at Python. (Not specific, how do you want to do it.)</li>
<li>I want to keep the customers happy. (Not measurable, how do you know they are happy?)</li>
<li>I want to read 200 fictions books the next year. (Probably not achievable, unless thats the only job you do.)</li>
</ol>


<p>Here are some good goals.</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to read the code of at least 8 open source libraries to learn how people are using Python.</li>
<li>I want at least 80 of my clients to rate "very happy" in the end of project review.</li>
<li>I want to read 10 fiction and 10 non fiction books in the next year.</li>
</ol>


<h3>How I manage my goals list</h3>

<p>I like keeping it simple. I have a dropbox folder which keeps my yearly todo list as a text file. Every month I will review the yearly todo list and create a monthly todo list. At the end of the month I will look at the monthly todo list and measure how many I was able to achieve before creating the next month's todo list.</p>
